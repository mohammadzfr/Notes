## Summary

### Opportunity Cost Takeaways
- Opportunity Cost is the most valuable alternative you give up to pursue said choice
- Every choice has opportunity cost, even non-monetary choices
- Ignore sunk costs
- PPF is used to visualize opportunity cost
- Scarcity creates limitations and opportunity cost

### Marginal Principle Takeaways
The marginal principle tells you to break “how many” decisions into
a series of smaller, marginal decisions.
- If the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost, then buy that
additional unit.
- Continue to buy additional units as long as the marginal benefit
is at least as large as the marginal cost (rational rule).
- Stop when the marginal benefit equals marginal cost.
- Economic surplus is maximized when marginal benefit equals
marginal cost.

### Interdependence Principle Takeaways
Your choices depend on:
1. Your other individual choices
2. The choices others make
3. Developments in other markets
4. Expectations about the future

### Shortened Economic Principles
1. The Marginal Principle (One more?)
2. The Cost-Benefit Principle (Do benefits exceed costs?)
3. The Opportunity Cost Principle (Or what?)
4. The Interdependence Principle (What Else?)

## Recap

In [the last lecture](/w2024/econ-100/lecture-2/#opportunity-cost-principle), we learned about the Opportunity Cost Principle, which is the **most valuable alternative** you
had to give up to pursue your choice ("what else?").

We discussed lists of opportunity costs, but there are ways to also visualize opportunity costs!

## Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)
A PPF Shows the different sets of output that are attainable with your scarce resources. ![PPF Graph](/PPF-Graph.png)


> **Example 1:** Let's say you have 3 hours to study for a Psychology and Economics Exam.
>
> If you spend an hour studying for Econ:
> - You gain 8 points in Econ
> - You lose 4 points in Psych
> 
> 
> 
> By moving up or down the graph, you are sacrificing something, which is your opportunity cost
> 
> Therefore, the opportunity cost by studying 1 hour for Econ is 4 points in Psych.
> 
> To reach a point with no sacrifices, you must change another factor that will create a new PPF (N), otherwise this is not possible

## Marginal Principle
The Marginal Principle states that decisions with quantities should be made incrementally
- Instead of "how many", think "one more"

**Marginal Benefit:** The extra benefit from one extra unit 

**Marginal Cost:** The extra costfrom one extra unit 

In order to evaluate when to apply the Marginal Principle, use the Figure below.

### Rational Rule
Based off the [Cost-Benefit Principle](/w2024/econ-100/lecture-2/#cost-benefit-principle), we know that as long as the **benefits exceed the costs** of a choice, it is a good choice. The same applies to Marginal Analysis on an **incremental level.**

**Rational Rule:** Keep doing something until **Marginal Costs = Marginal Benefits**

## Interdependence Principle
According to the **Interdependence Principle**, the best choices depends on:
1. Your other individual choices
    - You have limited resources
    - By doing one choice, you cannot do another
    - Things like time, money, energy are all factors
2. The choices others make
    - Other economic actors shape your choices
    - Other people, businesses, and governments affect this
3. Developments in other markets
    - Changes in a market affect choices
    - If a market is doing bad, you may change to another market
    - Changes in prices and opportunity affect this
4. Expectations about the future
    - Should I act today, tomorrow, or never
    - Doing something today shapes future decisions
