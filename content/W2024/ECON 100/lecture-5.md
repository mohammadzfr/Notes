## Shift in Demand Curve
Increase in Demand shifts demand curve to the right

Decrease in Demand shifts demand curve to the left

## Six Factors that Shift Demand Curve
### 1. Income
All choices are dependant on income since it's a limited asset.

**Normal Good**: Higher income, higher demand
- Smartphones
- Restaurant Meals
- Organic foods

**Inferior Good**: Higher income, lower demand
- Dumbphones
- Fast food
- Canned foods
### 2. Preferences
Preference changes may **shift** your personal demand curve, these reasons may include:
- Life-altering events (having a child means buying diapers)
- Marketing, fads, influencing (Kim Kardashian wore something, now everyone needs it)
- Social Pressure (People stop smoking cigarettes because it's considered nasty)
- Season/Weather (people buy sunscreen in the summer)
### 3. Prices of Related Goods
Other goods may affect your demand on a particular good

**Complimentary Goods**: Goods that go well together

**Demand** of your good **decreases** if complimentary good **price increases**
- Cereal and Milk
- Car and Gas

**Substitute Goods**: Goods that replace each other

**Demand** for good **increases** if **price** of substitute good **increases**
- Xbox and Playstation
- Coke and Pepsi
### 4. Expectations
Expectations about **future prices/suppy** influence **current demand**
- If gas prices are high now and you think they will fall, you may wait a few days to buy gas

### 5. Congestion + Network Effects
The choices of others affect your demand and usefulness from that item

**Network Effect**: Good usefulness rises when people using rises
- Social media
**Congestion Effect**: Good usefulness drops when people using rises
- Too many cars on the road, making a traffic jam

### 6. Type + Number of Buyers
Change in demographic may change market demand

**Type of Buyer**: When baby boomers age, retirement home demand will rise

**Number of Buyer**: **Increase** in population can **increase** demand
## Shift vs Movement on Demand Curve
If only **Price** changes, **movement** on demand curve
- This is a **change in quantity demanded**

If **other factors** change, **shift** in demand curve
- This is a **change in demand itself**
