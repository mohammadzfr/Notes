## Personal Thoughts
- This is the first semester where Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI, and other forms of LLM's are banned.
    - This is unsurprising but it will be interesting to see how this will be enforced:
    1. Simple AI plagiarism checkers? Probably the easiest method but is hard to conclusively prove
    2. Build "academic profiles" of students? Could require in-person written assessments which will be judged against future submitted assignments.
    3. Professors may just guess if something sounds too much like AI? Platforms like ChatGPT seem to overexplain, be too confident, and give broad but shallow answers.
- We need a $120 dollar textbook + online platform combo (no "alternative methods" unfortunately)
